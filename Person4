**Testing & Deployment Engineer - [Kwanele]**

As the Testing & Deployment Engineer, your role is essential in ensuring that the **Student Verification System** is reliable, secure, and easy to deploy. Here's a breakdown of your responsibilities and tasks:

### 1. **Write Test Cases to Verify Functionality**
- **Objective**: Ensure the system works as expected and meets the requirements.
- **Tools**: Use **Google Test** (for C++) to create unit tests and verify each function/component. Test cases should cover:
  - **Input Validation**: Ensure the user input is correctly handled (e.g., valid student ID, name, date of birth).
  - **Database Connection**: Verify the connection to MySQL/PostgreSQL is stable and working correctly.
  - **Verification Logic**: Test the core functionality of checking the registration status and issuing cards based on the student’s status.
  - **Boundary Tests**: Check for edge cases like empty fields, incorrect data formats, or students in unexpected states (e.g., unregistered students).
  - **Security**: Ensure the system is protected against SQL injection, unauthorized data access, and other potential vulnerabilities.

**Example Test Cases:**
- **Test 1**: Verify student details are correctly fetched from the database.
- **Test 2**: Ensure a registered student’s request is approved.
- **Test 3**: Ensure an unregistered student’s request is denied.
- **Test 4**: Check that invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect student ID format) are rejected.
- **Test 5**: Ensure security measures (e.g., SQL injection prevention) are effective.

### 2. **Check for Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Objective**: Identify and fix any issues that may arise during the testing phase.
- **Process**:
  - **Bug Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and security issues, assign tasks, and monitor progress.
  - **Security Audits**: Conduct a security review of the codebase, focusing on SQL queries, user inputs, and authentication processes.
  - **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system performs well under load, especially with larger databases or multiple requests.
  
**Common Issues to Look for:**
- Incorrect handling of database queries.
- Vulnerabilities like SQL injections.
- Memory leaks or inefficient resource usage in C++.
- Edge case handling (e.g., unexpected input types, null values).

### 3. **Document the Installation Process and Setup Guide**
- **Objective**: Make the deployment process simple and clear for other users and team members.
- **Tools**: Use **Markdown** to write clear and detailed setup guides.
- **Installation Guide Sections**:
  - **System Requirements**: List hardware and software requirements, including OS, database, programming language, and build system.
  - **Dependencies**: List any external libraries or tools needed (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL, Google Test).
  - **Database Setup**: Provide step-by-step instructions on how to create and configure the database.
  - **Build Instructions**: Include detailed steps for building the project using CMake or Makefile.
  - **Running the Application**: Explain how to compile, run, and test the system.
  - **Troubleshooting**: Provide common error messages and solutions for setup issues.

**Example Outline for the Setup Guide**:

# Student Verification System Setup Guide

## System Requirements
- OS: Linux/macOS/Windows
- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Programming Language: C++
- Build System: CMake/Makefile

## Dependencies
- MySQL/PostgreSQL database (ensure it's installed and running)
- Google Test (for unit testing)

## Database Setup
1. Download and install MySQL/PostgreSQL.
2. Create a database called `university_db`.
3. Run the following SQL to create the students table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
       student_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(50),
       last_name VARCHAR(50),
       date_of_birth DATE,
       department VARCHAR(100),
       year_of_study INT,
       registration_status BOOLEAN
   );
   ```
4. Populate the database with student records.

## Building the System
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/student-verification-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   cmake .
   make
   ```

## Running the Application
1. To start the verification system, run:
   ```bash
   ./student_verification
   ```
2. Enter student details when prompted for verification.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter a `Database connection error`, ensure that the database is running and the credentials are correct.
- If you face `undefined references` during compilation, ensure all dependencies are properly linked.
```

### 4. **Deploy the System (if necessary)**
- **Objective**: Deploy the Student Verification System on a server or as an executable for end-users.
- **Deployment Steps**:
  - If deploying to a server, ensure the database is correctly set up on the server.
  - Ensure the system is compiled and tested on the target environment.
  - If deploying as an executable, ensure it works across different platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows).
  - Set up logging and monitoring to track system performance after deployment.

### Team Workflow & Collaboration
- Each team member will work on their feature or module, and you will be responsible for testing those components.
- As part of the workflow:
  - **Pull Requests**: Ensure that all code is thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch.
  - **Code Reviews**: Participate in reviewing code to identify potential issues or improvements.
  - **GitHub Issues**: Monitor and manage issues reported by the team or users.

By following these steps, you'll ensure the **Student Verification System** is functional, secure, and easy to use, while also providing the necessary documentation for future users and developers.
